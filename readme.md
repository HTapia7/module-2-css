# Module 2 Challenge 

https://htapia7.github.io/module-2-css/


## As a new developer, I want to create a portfolio page for my future Employer

  * You will be presented with my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me. 

  * When you click on my navigation, it will scroll to my corresponding section.

  * When you click on a link, it will lead to a section of my work. 

  * When I hover over an application, it image should be larger in size than others.

  * When I click on the image of an application then I am taken to the application. 

  * When I reize the page or view on various screen and devices then I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
